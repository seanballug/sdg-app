# 🌍 APPDEV1 Angular Project – Supplier Management System

## 🎯 Sustainable Development Goal (SDG)
**SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production**

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a Single Page Application (SPA) built using Angular. It simulates a simple Supplier Management System that allows users to view, edit, and manage supplier information through a structured and interactive interface.

The system demonstrates key Angular concepts such as routing, services, dependency injection, event binding, and two-way data binding.

## 🌱 Why SDG 12?
We chose **SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production** because it focuses on improving resource efficiency and promoting sustainable business practices.

In real-world applications, supplier management systems play an important role in ensuring that organizations source materials responsibly, track supplier performance, and reduce waste in production and logistics processes.

This project reflects those ideas by simulating how companies can organize supplier data in a structured and efficient way.
